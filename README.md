# Basic Bot
When you want a custom bot for your Discord server, but can't code!

### How to use the bot
* Clone the bot's repository (look it up)
* Open the `config.yml` file
* Next to `token:`, put your bot token between the `""` (TL; DR on how to get it, go to [this website](https://discord.com/developers/applications), New Application, Bot, New Bot, Regenerate)
* Next to `prefix:`, put your prefixes in quotes with the prefixes separated by commas, for example
```yaml
prefix: ["!", "pls"]
```
* Next to `owners:`, put the **ID** of the owners **without quotes** separated by commas, for example
```yaml
owners: [123456789, 123454321]
```
* Download [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), and run the `bot.py` file
