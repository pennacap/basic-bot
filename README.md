# Basic Bot
When you want a custom bot for your Discord server, but can't code!

### How to use the bot
* Clone the bot's repository (look it up)
* Open the `.env` file
* Next to `TOKEN:`, put your bot token (TL; DR on how to get it, go to [this website](https://discord.com/developers/applications), New Application, Bot, New Bot, Regenerate)
* Download [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), and run the `bot.py` file

### Need Help?

**ENABLE ALL THE PRIVILEGED INTENTS OR THE BOT WILL NOT WORK**
